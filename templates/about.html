  <h1>The Playfair Cipher</h1>
  <p>The Playfair cipher was a battlefield cipher used by the british in world war 1.<br>Some of the other world war 1 ciphers are the following.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>the russians used a overcomplicated version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher">vigen√®re</a> cipher(it was hacked within 3 days.)</li>
      <li>the main french cryptography was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_de_Concordance">Tableau de Concordance.</a></li>
      <li>the germans used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFGVX_cipher">ADFGX and the ADFGVX</a> cipher.</li>
      <li>the US used native americans to talk in there native languages; they were sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker">code talkers.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Operation</h2>
<grid>
   <p>The first step is to choose a key, for this example we are going to use the key <strong>BATMAN AND ROBIN</strong> the next step
     is to take the spaces and duplicate letters out of the key. That would turn our key into <strong>BATMNDROI</strong>. Then you
     would take the key and turn it into a 5x5 grid by putting the key in the grid first and then the alpha bet behind it(removing
     any letters that are in the key. Also note that I and J are considered the same letter) the grid is below</p>
